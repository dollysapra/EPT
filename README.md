# EPT Evolutionary Piecemeal Training

This work was first published in "Constrained evolutionary piecemeal training to design convolutional neural networks" https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-55789-8_61

Best CIFAR-10 (92.5%) and PAMAP2(94.36%) can be downloaded from here- 

The code for PAMAP2 was used for paper "An evolutionary optimization algorithm for gradually saturating objective functions".
